1. Read the RTX Library Reference in the Keil IDE Help (see 1.12) and answer the following questions:
1.1 (1 point) In an RTX application, how to declare a memory pool named "mympool" that has 20 blocks 
    of memory with block size of 12 bytes?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1.2 (1 point) Write one line of code to initialize the "mympool".
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1.3 (1 point) What is the corresponding kernel function of _alloc_box()?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1.4 (1 point) What is the corresponding kernel function of _free_box()?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. (2 points) Read the rt_TypeDef.h file. What is the purpose of ret_val in the struct OS_TCB?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. Read the rt_List.c file and answer the following questions:
    You may want to further explore other functions in the rt_List.c file.
3.1 (2 points) What does the rt_put_prio() function do?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3.2 (2 points) What does the rt_get_first() function do?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. Read the rt_Task.c file and answer the following questions:
4.1 (2 points) What does the rt_block() function do?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4.2 (2 points) What does the rt_dispatch() function do?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. (4 points) How to set the return value of a function becomes a bit tricky when context
    switching is involved. One such example is os_mbx_wait() function. This function
    will return OS_R_MBX if the task has waited until a message was put in the mailbox
    (i.e. the task was blocked to wait for a message to arrive and then unblocked when
    the message arrives). Read the rt_Mailbox.c file and find the lines where the return
    value of OS_R_MBX is set. 
    Why does the corresponding kernel function rt_mbx_wait()
    not have a line to set the return value to OS_R_MBX? You may skip the code in
    functions isr_mbx_receive() and rt_mbx_psh() for the purpose of completing this
    assignment.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6. (2 points) To block a task, you will need to create a queue that the blocked tasks
    can stay. There are two global queues for now in the kernel and they are os_rdy and
    os_dly. What data structure do these two queues use?
