1. (1 point) Which global variable has the os_active_TCB array length information?


2. (1 point) What does os_active_TCB array in RTX_lib.c contain?


3. (1 point) Which global variable has the os idle task TCB information?


4. (1 point) Is the TCB of the os idle task an element in the os_active_TCB?


5. (1 point) Read rt_get_TID() code in rt_Task.c file. Assume that a non-idle task has a task ID of n, what is the index of this taskâ€™s TCB in the os_active_TCB array?


6. Read the rt_TypeDef.h file and answer the following questions.
6.1 (1 point) What is the purpose of the p_lnk variable in the struct OS_TCB?


6.2 (1 point) What is the purpose of tsk_stack and stack variables in struct OS_TCB?


6.3 (1 point) If you have a variable with type of struct OS_XCB *, will casting this variable to struct OS_TCB * keep the p_lnk field?


7. Read the rt_Task.c and RTX_lib.c files and answer the following question.
7.1 (2 points) What is the purpose of variables mp_tcb and mp_stk?
     You may want to search the entire source code to further explore how these variables are set and used (see Figure 1.28).


8. Read Section C.2.3 and study rt_init_stack() and rt_get_PSP() functions source code in HAL_CM3.c file and answer the following questions.
8.1 (2 points) Which registers are saved on the task stack?


8.2 (2 points) Which bits of which global variable contain the default task stack size in bytes?


8.3 (2 points) How to determine the memory address of the first item that is pushed onto a task stack?


8.4 (2 points) For a task that is not in RUNNING state, how to determine the memory address of the last item that is pushed onto its task stack (i.e. the top of the stack)?


8.5 (2 points) For a task that is in RUNNING state, how to determine the memory address of the last item that is pushed onto its task stack (i.e. the top of the stack)?
